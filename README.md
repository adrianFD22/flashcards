# Flashcards

A TUI for displaying flashcards for me to learn ncurses. Flashcards are stored in a user-defined directory as csv files. The program reads a file and starts showing a flashcard for the user to enter the correct answer. At the end, shows the number of correct answers.

usage: flash [-r] csv_file [n_flashcards]

For installation, compile main.c linking ncurses.
